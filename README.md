#### This currency convertor uses the FreeCurrencyAPI (https://freecurrencyapi.com/)

To run this on your own device, you'd need to sign up for an API key.
Paste that api key in an .env file on the root directory.

```cmd
API_KEY=your_api_key
```

I have limited the currency list to "USD", "EUR", "SGD", "CAD", "INR", "CNY", "JPY", but you can certainly add more. Check out https://freecurrencyapi.com/docs/currency-list for the complete list of supported currencies.
